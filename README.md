## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
- They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
<li>Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?</li>
<li>How well those variables describe the bike demands? </li>
- Business objective: Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables which will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
- Dataset being used is "day.csv" containing details about the ridership at various timeframe and in different conditions 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model suggests that good weather (higher temperature, lower humidity, lower windspeed) boosts ridership
- Seasonal and temporal factors (season 4 and Year) positively influence ridership.
- Certain external conditions, like holidays or bad weather, have a detrimental impact.
